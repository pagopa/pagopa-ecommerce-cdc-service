# pagopa-ecommerce-cdc-service
This repository is designed to manage and process events related to changes in ecommerce transactions event within the PagoPA ecommerce ecosystem. This service listens to events that signal changes (such as event creation) and ensures that these updates are appropriately handled in a (near) real-time manner.

### Populate the environment

The microservice needs a valid `.env` file in order to be run.

If you want to start the application without too much hassle, you can just copy `.env.local` with

```shell
$ cp .env.local .env
```

to get a good default configuration.

If you want to customize the application environment, reference this table:

### Run docker container

The easiest way to test the application is through a docker container connected to the dev environment. To do so follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env.dev` file starting from `.env.local` as example and replace the MongoDB values with dev environment settings:
   ```sh
   cp .env.local .env.dev
   ```
   Then update the MongoDB configuration in `.env.dev` to use the dev environment values.

2. Build and run the container:
   ```sh
   docker build -t pagopa-ecommerce-cdc-service:latest .
   docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
     --env-file .env.dev \
     pagopa-ecommerce-cdc-service:latest
   ```

The container will listen to dev environment changes and connect to the development MongoDB instance.

### Testing the CDC Service

Once the container is running, you can test the CDC functionality:

1. **Make test payments** using the dev checkout environment at https://dev.checkout.pagopa.it/
2. **Monitor CDC logs** by checking the container logs for event processing:
   ```sh
   docker logs -f <container_id>
   ```
   Look for log lines showing CDC events being processed as transactions flow through the system.

### Integration Testing with pagopa-ecommerce-local

For comprehensive integration testing with the full eCommerce ecosystem, you can use the [pagopa-ecommerce-local](https://github.com/pagopa/pagopa-ecommerce-local) repository.

The CDC service is integrated into the local development environment and provides:
- Complete eCommerce transaction flow
- Real-time CDC event processing  
- End-to-end testing capabilities
- Monitoring and observability tools

When running with the full environment, the CDC service connects to shared MongoDB and integrates with all other eCommerce services.
