### Populate the environment

The microservice needs a valid `.env` file in order to be run.

If you want to start the application without too much hassle, you can just copy `.env.local` with

```shell
$ cp .env.local .env
```

to get a good default configuration.

If you want to customize the application environment, reference this table:

### Run docker container

From current project directory run:

```sh
docker build -t pagopa-ecommerce-cdc-service .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 pagopa-ecommerce-cdc-service
```

### Integration Testing with pagopa-ecommerce-local

For comprehensive integration testing with the full eCommerce ecosystem, use the [pagopa-ecommerce-local](https://github.com/pagopa/pagopa-ecommerce-local) repository.

The CDC service is integrated into the local development environment and provides:
- Complete eCommerce transaction flow
- Real-time CDC event processing  
- End-to-end testing capabilities
- Monitoring and observability tools

When running with the full environment, the CDC service connects to shared MongoDB and integrates with all other eCommerce services.
